We are nestled into a holler with a view of mountains, a field of hops, and farm animals grazing. We offer our custom timber frame pavilion with a fire pit and plenty of flat pasture for you to hold your event.  We are happy to help you coordinate your event, raise food for your meals, and grow flowers for your special day.  We host outdoor only events from May to October.  <br\/><br\/>For more information and bookings <a href=\"\/pages\/contact\" title=\"Contact\">Contact Us<\/a><\/p>"
